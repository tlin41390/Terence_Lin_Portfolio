My work includes data processing, where Iâ€™ve utilized libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean, manipulate, and analyze datasets. Additionally, Iâ€™ve worked on creating large language models (LLMs) and machine learning models, applying Pythonâ€™s rich ecosystem of frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Beyond development, I also use Python for interview preparation, practicing algorithms and problem-solving skills with resources like LeetCode and HackerRank. Pythonâ€™s versatility and readability make it an ideal language for both my professional and personal projects.',

One of the key projects I developed was a memory allocator, which involved intricate knowledge of dynamic memory allocation techniques. Additionally, I created a program capable of detecting network compression among different virtual machines (VMs), giving me experience with low-level networking concepts. I also worked within the xv6 kernel, which allowed me to explore operating system principles and gain deeper insights into how kernels manage resources. My passion for dynamic memory allocation continues to drive my interest in system optimization and resource management.',
